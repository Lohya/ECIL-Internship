In the existing system there are following disadvantages: The existing is a manual process.

-> Here the patient’s registration is entered in the registers.

->Lots of paperwork is done, which may lead to loss of information.

->The doctors may forget their appointments with the patients.

->There is no separate user to interact with database.

-> Registration of patient’s process is manual.

->Difficult to maintain details of all staff working in the hospital and patient’s  details at the same time.


So, to reduce all the drawbacks of manual systems we are going for automated system.

           
EXISTING SYSTEM:

The existing system is a manual process. Here the patient’s registration is entered in the registers. Lots of paper work is done, which may lead to loss of information. 
The doctors may forget their appointments with the patients.

DISADVANTAGES:

->Doctors have to check the reports of the patients to know their previous history which consumes a lot of time.

->They have to come to the receptionist to check their daily appointments

->Registration of patient’s process is manual.

->The patient does have to wait for two or three days to get their lab reports and their total bill details.

->Difficult to maintain details of all staff working in the hospital and also patient’s   details at the same time.

->So in order to reduce all the draw backs of manual system we are going for automated system.

PROPOSED SYSTEM:

To overcome the difficulties in our existing system we use this system. The advantages of this system are:

ADVANTAGES:

->HMS helps to keep a track of the patient’s registering in a hospital. 

->This system supports the accessing of the patient’s previous case sheets and history.

->Helps the doctors to check their appointments for the day.

->Doctors will also use the system to keep track of the patients assigned to them.

->Flexible for future enhancements.

->User friendly interfaces for data entry and easy to navigate.

->Make our work easier.

->Searching for data is easy.

->High security is provided.

This HMS system is a self-contained system that manages activities of the hospital such operations scheduling, personal management, and administrative issues.The Patient Management System helps to maintain total patients in the Hospital. 
Patient records management system is a comprehensive patient care related clinical information system meant for doctors to enable quick review of previous medical history of patients and provide better quality treatment to the patients.

After logging in to the system there are three different actors’ administrator, doctor, receptionist.

TEST PLAN FOR HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:

Unit id: Hospital  Management System

Test case id: login page

Test type: unit level testing

Form name: login form

Base Table: login Table


PURPOSE:

Login table is used to save the user id, password and privileges provided by administrator to staff. By using these details they will perform operations.

TEST CASE DESCRIPTION

Check login for Hospital Patient Management System WITH VALID USERNAME AND PASSWORD

Username    varchar 2(20) Primary key

Password    varchar 2(20) Primary key

Role    varchar 2(20)


TEST COMPLETION CRITERIA:

When expected results match the actual results after performing tests the test is considered to be complete.

TEST PROCESS:

Login form will be used for allowing correct user to use the software. Every person will be given a username & password

CONCLUSION

Hospital  Management System is entry in to an area of information processing that is significantly different from existing ones. Because, of this fact a different approach to Hospital  Management System development and implementation is called for business engaged in launching or upgrading hospital management system must contain wide variety of factors that can influence activities.                                                                                                     
Hospital Management System make possible to simplify, improve & automate the hospitals activities as well as automatic transfer and exchange of information and management of administrative , handling numerical data without human operation.
